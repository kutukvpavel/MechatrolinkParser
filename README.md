# MechatrolinkParser

A parser for Mechatrolink-I/II commucation snapshots.

Done: essential stuff, i.e. text import, Manchester decoder, HDLC parser and data structures, also some basic commandline interface. Command and field database engine, FCS calculator (uses HashFunction.CRC NuGet package).

Encoder (I presume Yaskawa encoders use CC-Link which turns out to be very similar to mechatrolink) support is experimental, the protocol has not been reversed completely yet, though this repo contains some useful info: https://github.com/rene-dev/stmbl/issues/58

Todo: visualisation (probably use my LogicSnifferSTM plotter), improve command database. **P.S. Full Mechatrolink-II system manual is exclusively available on CSDN.net (costs 22 C-points, though I don't know what they even are). Help appreciated.**

Supported logic analyzer export formats: Kingst .txt (similar to CSV), LogicSnifferSTM (colon-separated). Logic analyzer has to be connected through a receiver assembly to the mechatrolink bus, see https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/451498/reverse-engineering-rs485-mechatrolink-ii-front-end-design . In short, a 1:1 350uH transformer + лљлю26LS32-compatible RS485 receiver.

Command/field database was created using generic manuals (search "MECHATROLINK-I-II" on Baidu and look for Command Manuals ("for stepper motors" etc)). Therefore, beware that your hardware may use slightly different commandset.
